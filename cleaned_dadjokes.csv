Wow I really did not expect so many people to see this post or to take the time to comment and reach out to me. Thank you all so much for your thoughts and kind words. It really means a lot. This is a great community and I'm so glad to have found it. As a mom to two beautiful little jokesters, I will absolutely continue pestering them with daily jokes and keep the tradition and the laughter alive. 

For those asking, his favorite jokes were the really long ones that took forever to tell and had bad/ the best punchlines. The one that immediately sticks out was posted here either Sunday or Monday and was the last one I got to tell him. I will see if I can find it and figure out how to link. It was about a farmer who really loved tractors.

589,i3x7g8,12246,"Three boys go into a haunted house. One brought a knife, one brought a gun and one brought some cough drops","They crept in. It was pitch black and stone quiet. They were suddenly starting to regret this dare. Stupidly, only one brought a flash light. The aggressive darkness and inky black yielded with grudging compliance but always seeming to push back. They moved cautiously onward amid the dust and cobwebs. The floor creaked. They breathed in tight, quick breaths. You could hear a pin drop.

Suddenly, there was a deep moan. ""OOOOOOOOUUUUU"". It seemed from below them. The house had been abandoned for years. Who *or what* could make such a sound? The boys looked at each other, but continued on, hearts pounding in their chests.

As they proceeded into the kitchen they encountered a swarm of flies. Buzzing and beating their necks and faces, they rushed and stumbled to the door, not stopping to see what they were truly feasting on. They slammed the door behind them. Maybe a body? But no way were they going back to find out. And again came the sound, ""ooooOOOOOooooOOUUU"" but louder this time, and closer.

They proceeded through the dark into the dining room. They saw a fully set dining table covered in cob webs. Dust-covered regal-looking glasses, goblets and silverware adorned the table. Spiders climbed on ivory plates. Clearly a house of privilege and set for a grand feast which never happened. 

Or, perhaps, met a fatal end?

They pushed on. But again that unearthly howl. 

""oooooOOOOOOOOOOOUuuuuUUUUuuUUOOOOooo"". 

They found the basement staircase, and from below, the sounds seemed to be emanating. Could they proceed? Would they? Did they dare? Two of the boys looked at each other, faces filled with worry. 

But the third said, confidently, ""We're going down there."" Not wanting to seem the weaker, the other two boys steeled themselves and nodded.

The stairs creaked and groaned evily under their feet. The rickety banister shook in angry defiance. Insects and vermin scattered underneath them with every step. They were descending into hell, they knew, but none would turn back.

And the sound: ""oOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUuuuuUUOOOO"". Now loud enough to fill not only their heads but seeming to claw at their very souls! 

Now at the basement door! The antique, crying squeak of the hinges eeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEee made the boys wince and almost cover their ears. But they had to know. WHAT is making that horrible, terrible sound?

**""ooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUoooooUUUUUUUOOOOOOO""**

In the center of the basement lay an unholy coffin! A twisted artistic expression of murder, decay and disease! Brutish, incorrect lengths had been forced together, buckling the wood and bulging the steel at points, as if death, itself, were attempting to escape. It was festooned with beast-like emblems and decrepid artifacts: skulls, antlers, skins, totems, and drenched in the color of blood!

It was TRUE! The house really *was* haunted!

**""OOOoooOOOoOOooOoOouuUUUUUuuuuUOOuouOUO""**

Now the boys realized with sheer horror that the insane moaning was definitely coming from the coffin! 

Before the boys could turn and run, the coffin began to shake! They froze. 

Then it suddenly LIFTED off the ground! They gaped in terror! 

Shaking violently and rising, the coffin started to turn. It turned and turned, and gained speed. It was spinning in the air before them! A mix of terror and fascination gripped them. Unable to look away. Unable to run. It spun faster and faster AND FASTER!

**""OOOoooOOOoOOooOoOouuUUUUUuuuuUOOuouOUOOOOOOOoo""**

The first boy with the knife slashed in the air in front of him, as if to stab away at the evil! Then he dropped the knife and ran back up the stairs, never to be seen again.

The second boy with the gun fired warning shots at the ceiling BANG! BANG!, but then thought better of it, dropped his gun and also ran up the stairs, and also was never to be seen again.

The third boy stood there calmly, reached into his pocket and popped a cough drop into his mouth. He sucked on it for a bit.

And the coffin stopped.

A few months ago I noticed that she became annoyed by my dumb jokes that were only funny to me, but that just made it even funnier to me so I continued telling all these dad jokes to her and died laughing every time.

She puts up with it because she loves me. At least I thought so.

We were always 100% honest with each other and I'm still shaken by the things she told me today.

I sent her probably one of my worst dad jokes ever (that I stole from reddit), and she just couldn't take it anymore and told me how stupid my jokes are and that she doesn't know if she'll be able to put up with it much longer.

But that's not the worst part, I actually appreciated her honesty and considered the possibility to stop with all the stupid jokes and become more serious in the relationship.

The worst part is that she lied to me for the first time in all these years. I felt like I just couldn't trust her anymore and everything I thought I knew about her as a person just became questionable. I need your advice on how to react to this huge lie...

The next day, he’s led to the electric chair.  They strap him in, pull the switch, and... nothing happens.  

There’s never been a failure before.  But because you cannot punish a person twice for the same crime, the court is forced to let him go free.  

Within a week’s time, naturally, the man, who is obsessed with trains, goes and steals another one.  

He doesn’t care that he can’t drive it or that he failed catastrophically before; he is obsessed with trains and his only desire is to operate one.  As before, he crashes it, and kills several people.  

Again, he stands trial, and again, he is sentenced to death, showing no remorse, only delight that he got to operate the train.  

His last meal request is a single banana.  When he goes to the chair, the executioner pulls the switch, but nothing happens.  He goes free again.  

The train-obsessed maniac, once more on the loose, wastes no time in hijacking a train and crashing it.  

His trial is speedy, because this has already happened twice, and he is sentenced to death.  

They ask him what he’d like for his last meal.  “A single banana,” he says.  

“Oh, no you don’t, you son of a bitch.  We’re on to you, now.  We know all about your little banana trick, and you’re not escaping this time!”

The guards refuse his request, and instead serve him a standard last meal of steak, potatoes, and berry cobbler.  

The next morning they strap him into the electric chair, pull the switch, and... nothing happens.  

“*Did you give him the banana?*” demands the head guard.  

“No, sir!  He asked for the banana but we didn’t give it to him, we swear!” says one of the guards.

He doesn’t care that he can’t drive it or that he failed catastrophically before; he is obsessed with trains and his only desire is to operate one.  As before, he crashes it, and kills several people.  

Again, he stands trial, and again, he is sentenced to death, showing no remorse, only delight that he got to operate the train.  

His last meal request is a single banana.  When he goes to the chair, the executioner pulls the switch, but nothing happens.  He goes free again.  

The train-obsessed maniac, once more on the loose, wastes no time in hijacking a train and crashing it.  

His trial is speedy, because this has already happened twice, and he is sentenced to death.  

They ask him what he’d like for his last meal.  “A single banana,” he says.  

“Oh, no you don’t, you son of a bitch.  We’re on to you, now.  We know all about your little banana trick, and you’re not escaping this time!”

The guards refuse his request, and instead serve him a standard last meal of steak, potatoes, and berry cobbler.  

The next morning they strap him into the electric chair, pull the switch, and... nothing happens.  

“*Did you give him the banana?*” demands the head guard.  

“No, sir!  He asked for the banana but we didn’t give it to him, we swear!” says one of the guards.  

Turns out the banana had nothing to do with anything.  He was just a really bad conductor."

The man said, "" just lead me to the bell and I'll show you.""

So they walked up the long stairwell that led to the top of the belfry. Once at the top, the man walked over to the bell to get a good look at it. He then proceeded back up against the furthest wall and leapt into a sprint, face first into the bell.

He plummeted 65 feet below to his death. Tragically, no sound came from the bell.

When the police arrived an hour later, they asked the monk if he knew the man.

The monk simply said, ""No. His face doesn't ring a bell either.""

But wait, there's more...

The next day another man with no arms showed up at the monastery and told the monk ""Yesterday the man who died here was my brother. This was his lifelong dream. If it's ok with you, I'd like to try just once for him.""

The monk certainly couldn't refuse and slowly led the man up the long stairwell. 

Once at the top the man walked over to the bell. He kissed the spot where his brother's face hit the bell just a day before and walked back to the edge of the furthest wall.

The priest watched in horror as once again a man hurled himself face first towards the bell, but at the last minute the man tucked his chin, stopped at the last moment and slammed his head into the side of the bell. 

The bell rang with the loudest clang the countryside had heard in years. In fact, it was so loud the man cried out in agonizing pain, lost his balance and fell to his death below.

951,a3pzal,10505,The ultimate Dad Joke - Bulgarian Train Man,"This has been my favourite joke for at least a couple years now.

A man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving, and runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to court, and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, he's on death row and the executioner approaches him.

""What would you like for your last meal?""

""I would like a banana please.""

The executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into the electric chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In Bulgaria, an act of divine intervention means you get released.

A few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2 people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from last time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.

Some time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with a train. Exacberated, the executioner approaches him for the third time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I dont get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didnt let you eat any bananas!""

""Its not the bananas. *I'm a bad conductor.*""
