17491,"SERIOUS: This subreddit needs to understand what a ""dad joke"" really means. I don't want to step on anybody's toes here, but the amount of non-dad jokes here in this subreddit really annoys me. First of all, dad jokes CAN be NSFW, it clearly says so in the sub rules. Secondly, it doesn't automatically make it a dad joke if it's from a conversation between you and your child. Most importantly, the jokes that your CHILDREN tell YOU are not dad jokes. The point of a dad joke is that it's so cheesy only a dad who's trying to be funny would make such a joke. That's it. They are stupid plays on words, lame puns and so on. There has to be a clever pun or wordplay for it to be considered a dad joke.

16664,"A woman is walking through the park when she sees a very attractive man sitting on a park bench. He's reading a book and eating some fruit out of a Tupperware container. Slowly the woman gathers the courage to go ask the man out... 
So, she walks over and takes a seat next to him on the bench, turns to him and says, ""Sorry to bother you. I know this may be a little forward but I would love to grab coffee with you some time."" 

Flattered, the man responds, ""Sure... but what makes you so certain you and I would get along so well?""

""Well..."" the woman says. ""A couple things, actually. I noticed you were wearing an Iron Maiden t-shirt. Iron Maiden are my favorite band of all time. When they went on their reunion tour in 1999, my parents took me to see them in Cleveland. I was 12 years old and it was the first concert I ever went to. I absolutely love Iron Maiden.""

The man can't believe it. 

""I saw them play Cleveland in '99! First concert I ever went to on my own. My best friend Jimmy Spitz and I told our parents we were sleeping at each others' houses, snuck out, took a bus into the city and saw them play at the Plain Dealer Pavillion!"" 

Naturally, they're both shocked.

""If that isn't weird enough..."" says the woman. ""I noticed you're reading Mark Twain. I was a communications major in university and I actually wrote my thesis on Mark Twain and how he used satire as a lens to comment on current events of the time, comparing him to satirical news sources of today. He's my favorite author.""

Now the man is really taken aback, ""Get out of here! I was an English major in university! I specialized in 19th century American literature and this is like my fourth or fifth time reading Tom Sawyer, I absolutely love Mark Twain.""

They both can't believe it...this has got to be a match made in heaven.

""Ok..."" the woman says. ""Well, buckle up because here's the icing on the cake. I noticed you're eating a prune. Prunes are my absolute favorite fruit. When I was a kid, my grandfather lived on a farm. He had an orchard that mainly grew apples and some lemons, but he knew how much my sister and I loved prunes so he kept a couple of plum trees. Every year at the end of the summer, we'd go up and harvest the plums with him. He'd dry them and by the time we'd go back to his place for Thanksgiving he'd always have those prunes saved just for us. They're my favorite fruit! I love prunes, you're eating a prune, this has got to be fate. What do you say?""

14159,"A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.""

The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?"" ""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet..

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1500!"" she cried, ""$1500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $50, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1500."""

12246,"Three boys go into a haunted house. One brought a knife, one brought a gun and one brought some cough drops They crept in. It was pitch black and stone quiet. They were suddenly starting to regret this dare. Stupidly, only one brought a flash light. The aggressive darkness and inky black yielded with grudging compliance but always seeming to push back. They moved cautiously onward amid the dust and cobwebs. The floor creaked. They breathed in tight, quick breaths. You could hear a pin drop.

Suddenly, there was a deep moan. ""OOOOOOOOUUUUU"". It seemed from below them. The house had been abandoned for years. Who *or what* could make such a sound? The boys looked at each other, but continued on, hearts pounding in their chests.

As they proceeded into the kitchen they encountered a swarm of flies. Buzzing and beating their necks and faces, they rushed and stumbled to the door, not stopping to see what they were truly feasting on. They slammed the door behind them. Maybe a body? But no way were they going back to find out. And again came the sound, ""ooooOOOOOooooOOUUU"" but louder this time, and closer.

They proceeded through the dark into the dining room. They saw a fully set dining table covered in cob webs. Dust-covered regal-looking glasses, goblets and silverware adorned the table. Spiders climbed on ivory plates. Clearly a house of privilege and set for a grand feast which never happened. 

Or, perhaps, met a fatal end?

They pushed on. But again that unearthly howl. 

""oooooOOOOOOOOOOOUuuuuUUUUuuUUOOOOooo"". 

They found the basement staircase, and from below, the sounds seemed to be emanating. Could they proceed? Would they? Did they dare? Two of the boys looked at each other, faces filled with worry. 

But the third said, confidently, ""We're going down there."" Not wanting to seem the weaker, the other two boys steeled themselves and nodded.

The stairs creaked and groaned evily under their feet. The rickety banister shook in angry defiance. Insects and vermin scattered underneath them with every step. They were descending into hell, they knew, but none would turn back.

And the sound: ""oOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUuuuuUUOOOO"". Now loud enough to fill not only their heads but seeming to claw at their very souls! 

Now at the basement door! The antique, crying squeak of the hinges eeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEee made the boys wince and almost cover their ears. But they had to know. WHAT is making that horrible, terrible sound?

**""ooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUoooooUUUUUUUOOOOOOO""**

In the center of the basement lay an unholy coffin! A twisted artistic expression of murder, decay and disease! Brutish, incorrect lengths had been forced together, buckling the wood and bulging the steel at points, as if death, itself, were attempting to escape. It was festooned with beast-like emblems and decrepid artifacts: skulls, antlers, skins, totems, and drenched in the color of blood!

It was TRUE! The house really *was* haunted!

**""OOOoooOOOoOOooOoOouuUUUUUuuuuUOOuouOUO""**

Now the boys realized with sheer horror that the insane moaning was definitely coming from the coffin! 

Before the boys could turn and run, the coffin began to shake! They froze. 

Then it suddenly LIFTED off the ground! They gaped in terror! 

Shaking violently and rising, the coffin started to turn. It turned and turned, and gained speed. It was spinning in the air before them! A mix of terror and fascination gripped them. Unable to look away. Unable to run. It spun faster and faster AND FASTER!

**""OOOoooOOOoOOooOoOouuUUUUUuuuuUOOuouOUOOOOOOOoo""**

The first boy with the knife slashed in the air in front of him, as if to stab away at the evil! Then he dropped the knife and ran back up the stairs, never to be seen again.

The second boy with the gun fired warning shots at the ceiling BANG! BANG!, but then thought better of it, dropped his gun and also ran up the stairs, and also was never to be seen again.

The third boy stood there calmly, reached into his pocket and popped a cough drop into his mouth. He sucked on it for a bit.

And the coffin stopped.

Mum always loved to wear sarongs (fabric wraps that go around the torso and drape downward a bit like a long skirt would), so my uncle suggested that she wear a sarong in there.

The funeral director looked a bit confused, as did some of our family members, to which my uncle added:

""What's *sarong* with that?""

I started laughing like an idiot. He was proud of it too. The funeral director was rather shocked. We assured her, and our more proper relatives, that Mum would've absolutely loved the joke (which is very true).

His delivery was perfect. I'll never forget the risk he took. We sometimes recall the moment as a way help cushion the blows of the grieving process.

A few months ago I noticed that she became annoyed by my dumb jokes that were only funny to me, but that just made it even funnier to me so I continued telling all these dad jokes to her and died laughing every time.

She puts up with it because she loves me. At least I thought so.

We were always 100% honest with each other and I'm still shaken by the things she told me today.

I sent her probably one of my worst dad jokes ever (that I stole from reddit), and she just couldn't take it anymore and told me how stupid my jokes are and that she doesn't know if she'll be able to put up with it much longer.

But that's not the worst part, I actually appreciated her honesty and considered the possibility to stop with all the stupid jokes and become more serious in the relationship.

The worst part is that she lied to me for the first time in all these years. I felt like I just couldn't trust her anymore and everything I thought I knew about her as a person just became questionable. I need your advice on how to react to this huge lie...

11371,"A man obsessed with trains finally steals one and immediately crashes it, killing several people.   

At the trial, the man is found guilty of multiple murders and sentenced to death.  

Before he faces his sentence, he’s offered a last meal, and asks for a single banana, which is given to him.  

The next day, he’s led to the electric chair.  They strap him in, pull the switch, and... nothing happens.  

There’s never been a failure before.  But because you cannot punish a person twice for the same crime, the court is forced to let him go free.  

Within a week’s time, naturally, the man, who is obsessed with trains, goes and steals another one.  

He doesn’t care that he can’t drive it or that he failed catastrophically before; he is obsessed with trains and his only desire is to operate one.  As before, he crashes it, and kills several people.  

Again, he stands trial, and again, he is sentenced to death, showing no remorse, only delight that he got to operate the train.  

His last meal request is a single banana.  When he goes to the chair, the executioner pulls the switch, but nothing happens.  He goes free again.  

The train-obsessed maniac, once more on the loose, wastes no time in hijacking a train and crashing it.  

His trial is speedy, because this has already happened twice, and he is sentenced to death.  

They ask him what he’d like for his last meal.  “A single banana,” he says.  

“Oh, no you don’t, you son of a bitch.  We’re on to you, now.  We know all about your little banana trick, and you’re not escaping this time!”

The guards refuse his request, and instead serve him a standard last meal of steak, potatoes, and berry cobbler.  

The next morning they strap him into the electric chair, pull the switch, and... nothing happens.  

“*Did you give him the banana?*” demands the head guard.  

“No, sir!  He asked for the banana but we didn’t give it to him, we swear!” says one of the guards.  

Turns out the banana had nothing to do with anything.  He was just a really bad conductor."

Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out a dainty little fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poot. Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked over at the dog that had been snoozing at the women's feet, and said in a rather stern voice, ""Ginger!"" The woman thought, ""This is great!"" and a big smile came across her face. A couple minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, she didn't hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The father again looked at the dog and yelled, ""Dammit, Ginger!"" Once again the woman smiled and thought, ""Yes!"" A few minutes later the woman had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing. Again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, ""Dammit, Ginger, get away from her before she shits on you!""

The man said, "" just lead me to the bell and I'll show you.""

So they walked up the long stairwell that led to the top of the belfry. Once at the top, the man walked over to the bell to get a good look at it. He then proceeded back up against the furthest wall and leapt into a sprint, face first into the bell.

He plummeted 65 feet below to his death. Tragically, no sound came from the bell.

When the police arrived an hour later, they asked the monk if he knew the man.

The monk simply said, ""No. His face doesn't ring a bell either.""

But wait, there's more...

The next day another man with no arms showed up at the monastery and told the monk ""Yesterday the man who died here was my brother. This was his lifelong dream. If it's ok with you, I'd like to try just once for him.""

The monk certainly couldn't refuse and slowly led the man up the long stairwell. 

Once at the top the man walked over to the bell. He kissed the spot where his brother's face hit the bell just a day before and walked back to the edge of the furthest wall.

The priest watched in horror as once again a man hurled himself face first towards the bell, but at the last minute the man tucked his chin, stopped at the last moment and slammed his head into the side of the bell. 

The bell rang with the loudest clang the countryside had heard in years. In fact, it was so loud the man cried out in agonizing pain, lost his balance and fell to his death below.

Once again the police showed up, and once again asked the monk if he knew the man's name to which the monk replied, ""no, but he's a dead ringer for his brother.""

10505,"The ultimate Dad Joke - Bulgarian Train Man This has been my favourite joke for at least a couple years now.

A man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving, and runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to court, and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, he's on death row and the executioner approaches him.

""What would you like for your last meal?""

""I would like a banana please.""

The executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into the electric chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In Bulgaria, an act of divine intervention means you get released.

A few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2 people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from last time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.

Some time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with a train. Exacberated, the executioner approaches him for the third time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I dont get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didnt let you eat any bananas!""

""Its not the bananas. *I'm a bad conductor.*""
